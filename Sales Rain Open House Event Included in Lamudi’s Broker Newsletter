Sales Rain held an open house event last Thursday, July 7, 2022, at the company’s 3rd site in Ortigas Center, located on the 11th Floor of One Corporate Center along Julia Vargas Avenue, Pasig City. The event was hosted by the company’s Sales Team, headed by Sales Rain Country Head Vin Kumar, and facilitated by Sales Rain Sales Managers Ella Ramos, Micah Arriola, and Zolf Hasan. This open house for licensed real estate agents and freelance brokers was included in Lamudi’s (the no.1 real estate marketplace in the Philippines) newsletter for July 2022, which was sent to its 40K subscribers of opt-in commercial real estate professionals.  
The “Sales Rain Open House Event” in Ortigas provided brokers with a better understanding of call center seat leasing facilities, flexible private and semi-private offices, and virtual office package plans that are being offered by expertly managed serviced office providers. Agents who are only familiar with residential real estate were introduced to the growing business environment of the Serviced Offices Industry and were given the opportunity to participate in Sales Rain’s lucrative broker commission scheme for each registered client referral that will generate successfully closed deals. Furthermore, high-value incentives are also part of the commission package that includes iPhones, iPads, and Macbooks.
The afternoon activity has been productive with the attendance of the following brokers: Michelle Cervera of Santos Knight Frank, Larry Barberan of Federal Land, JC Valderama – Cushman and Wakefield, and Rafael Siapco of RTSJ Real Estate Brokerage (RS Property Manila). The Sales Rain Admin and Facilities Team in Ortigas also assisted in organizing the open house event to ensure that all the visitors were well taken care of. With the company’s continuous pursuit to build more income opportunities for licensed and freelance brokers, Sales Rain plans to spearhead monthly events that aim to widen its network of commercial real estate professionals.
